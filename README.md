#Wire Game with Arduino

This package is an arduino script for an upgraded Wire Game.
This version allow user to have his personnal score at the end of the game and compare it with other player.

Score is defined by two parameter :
- time elapsed for going from the "start" point to the "end" point
- number of error (contact with the wire)

Using Arduino is maybe overkill, but this is what I had under the hand.

Materials :
- Arduino Nano
- LCD Screen
- Green Led (game is running)
- Red Led (error / contact)
- coper wire
- pieces of wood to make the support.
